This design is not finished

The goal of this tutorial project is to demonstrate the use of MATLAB to HDL translation for building a QPSK transceiver. The unique element of this design is the liberal use of System Objects in the design.

Files in this directory provide a demonstration for a complete QPSK ad hoc wireless transceiver.

The complete set of code for the physical layer is written in MATLAB and translated to hardware using Mathworks HDL Coder. 

The MAC and peripheral (serial port) interfaces are written in C.

This example differs from QPSK_Radio in that it uses newer tools and also highlights the use of MATLAB System Objects in the Communications Toolbox.
